If you ever landed on the page where Facebook lists its Software Engineering
[openings](https://www.facebook.com/careers/department?dept=engineering) you can see a
common theme in the requirements for the *Core Data Science* positions:

* Ph.D. in a relevant technical field, or 4+ years experience in a relevant role.

Want to try Google? Besides your degree you need at least 2 years of experience as a minimum
requirement!

* MS or other advanced degree in an analytical field [...] or equivalent practical experience;
* 2 years of experience in graph or network theory;
* 2 years of experience as an analyst or in an analytical role [...].

What about Amazon? Hmm, preferred qualification is kind of high there as well!

* PhD degree in a quantitative field.

You may think that I'm cheating by only mentioning the A-player in the market, but try finding a
good job in any other field where you don't need either a MS in a relevant field or some years of field experience.

But then why do we find so many courses (I won't reveal who's offering them) that promises that, after finishing them you'll

> "Speak the language of a Data Scientist in terms of statistics, data transformation, tricks (!), algorithms and theory!"

all only after 4 days of taking the course? I have another theory, corroborated when I look at the description of data science courses from more prestigious institutions: Coursera, for example, after 12 hours/week for eight weeks (equivalent to 12 full days) [only promises][promise] that the course will only

> "Introduce yourself to the basics of data science"

So what is going on here?

# Science as a Scam (not your ordinary SaaS)

These miraculous courses seems to be very often offered by consultancy firms. These firms also sells data science services so I imagine interactions such as:

> **Client** : 

> Hey, we would love if one of our analyst would be able to do some machine learning magic, do you have anything for that?

> **Consultancy firm:**

> Of course! He should follow our "Become a Data Science ninja in 4 days" course. It just costs a couple of grands. See, you can sign up here in our badly customized Wordpress website [Sorry, I couldn't resist the Wordpress joke, mainly because it's true]

> **Client** : 

> Ok fine, there your go.

Analyst takes the course, get shown how Google/Facebook/Amazon are doing, with enough theory to
make data science even more dark magic than what it seems. Then the client asks the analyst:

> **Client** : 

> Hey, how was the course?

> **Analyst:**

> Good, really nice, I learned a tons of exciting things.

> **Client** : 

> Great. Can you build a real-time recommender for our website?

> **Analyst:**

> Ehr, no, I barely know what a recommender is, let alone building a real-time one.

> **Client** : 

> WTF?

> **Analyst:**

> Well, but the consultancy firm should be able to help us, those guys are rock solid.

> **Client** : 

> Ok, let me call them.

---

> **Client** : 

> Hi there, I was wondering if you could build us a real-time recommender system for our website. Is it possible?

> **Consultancy firm**: 

> Of course we can, but a real-time recommender system is so old-school [Translation: we don't know how to build one]. Let me tell you what you really want, and we can do it for the very modest fee of 3 grands a day. If it seems like a lot of money, you can't imagine what it will mean for the revenues of your company. You'll earn it back in a week.

> **Client** : 

> Cool, let's do that.

We all know how these things ends. The client usually gets lock into a service provider and the
analyst does not really learn anything. Because if you are in this business model, your interests
are reached when this analyst will **not** learn!

# The GoDataDriven™ way

At GoDataDriven, we believe things should be different. We believe in short, to the point trainings
that do not over-promise (that is why we are a Cloudera partner: we believe their trainings set the
expectations right where they should be) and effectively empowers the participants to apply what
they've learnt. On the other side, we also know miracles probably do not happen to aspiring data
scientists: we are therefore always willing to help the client with training on the job, but we are
reluctant to do so for long period of times (the median project length is about 4 weeks).

In these four weeks we at least teach the in's and out's of the area we are working on: far from
make you speak the language of a data scientist, but at least able to continue on the right track
once we leave, and laying a solid foundations, allowing continuous growth for your people.

This is without doubts harder (learning data science take years!) but the long term benefits can't
be overstated. Do it the right way, do it the GoDataDriven™ way!
