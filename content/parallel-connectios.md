Some time ago Niels and me set out to build a new Python package to query multiple databases in
parallel, merging the results, and presenting them to the end user as if the query was executed on
a single database.

The results are now on our [Github](http://github.com/godatadriven/ParallelConnection) page and on
[PyPi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/parallel-connection/0.1.1) self.

Most of the work (which is not much, admittedly) for this was done during our monthly full day
hackatons, where we are encouraged and given the time  to work on this sort of projects (and blog
about them).

By the way, we're [hiring](http://www.godatadriven.com/careers.html).
