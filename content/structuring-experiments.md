Experimenting, as part of your everyday business processes, seems to be the new hype.  Many things
have been said how useful they are, how to run them, what you can get out of them. Here I will take
a different approach: what doesn't work when you want to create a successful experiment culture?

By working with a number of different companies that started to experiment, I've found that often
they don't create any structure around their efforts. This is visible in two main ways:

1. The core mission of the company is often left behind. By that I don't mean finding new business
   venues, new sources of revenues, etc. What I mean is there is no link between the experiments
   that are running and the reason the company exists. If you think about many successful projects
   that started out as experiments, they're basically all aligned with, or serve, the core of the
   company. The famous Google email service, [gmail](https://gmail.com), is a perfect example: while
   from the outside it seems that an email service has nothing to do with the search giant we all
   know Google to be, searching is not Google's mission. Instead:

   > Google's mission is to organize the worldâ€™s information and make it universally accessible and useful.[^1]

   When you see it that way, gmail perfectly fits with the mission. It allowed Google to store,
   index, and analyze billions of emails, and to use that to make Google even better.

2. Experimenting is confused with lack of rule, process, etcetera. While this might not be
   problematic for short run experiments, it is disastrous in the long term. If the team is not
   communicating, not sharing knowledge, not setting goals, it is extremely difficult to create a
   thriving experiment culture. People will get the idea that good results come from a cowboy-like
   attitude. Nothing is more far from the truth. Set clear goals and keep working towards them.
   The value of what you're doing is not "I don't know what I'm doing". Rather: "I want to try
   something new".
