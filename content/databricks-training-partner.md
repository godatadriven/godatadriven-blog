### Databricks and Apache Spark

Apache Spark is a powerful open source processing engine built around speed, ease of use, and sophisticated analytics. Since its release, Spark has seen rapid adoption by enterprises across a wide range of industries. Internet powerhouses such as Yahoo, Baidu, and Tencent, have eagerly deployed Spark at massive scale, collectively processing multiple petabytes of data on clusters of over 8,000 nodes. It has quickly become the largest open source community in big data, with over 1000 contributors from 200+ organizations.
