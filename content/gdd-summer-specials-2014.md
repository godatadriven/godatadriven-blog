Summer can be slow sometimes in the office. That is why GoDataDriven, in collaboration with Xebia,

+ [Introduction Ansible & Hadoop](http://training.xebia.com/summer-specials/summer-special-introduction-ansible-hadoop)
  Learn the basics of Hadoop, how to setup and configure a cluster and how to get data into a
  cluster and do data analysis.
+ [R & pandas: Side by Side](http://training.xebia.com/summer-specials/summer-special-r-and-pandas-side-by-side)
  Learn two for the price of one! Both R and Pandas have become important tools in (big) data
  analytics. This training is a dual introduction to as well as a comparison of R and (Python)
  Pandas. So, if you are proficient in one language, then this course will help you to quickly get
  up to speed with the other. On the other hand, if you are a beginner in both, we will get you up
  to speed in both and it is up to you to decide which one fits your needs the best.
+ [D3](http://training.xebia.com/summer-specials/summer-special-d3)
  This Summer Special helps you to start independently working with D3 as well as to understand the
  possibilities of interactive visualisations on the web.
