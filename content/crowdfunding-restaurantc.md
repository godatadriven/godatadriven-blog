<span class="lead">Earlier this month Restaurant C opened as the latest hot spot in Amsterdam. In order to kickstart the new operation, the owners, brothers Michiel and Lucas van der Eerde, started a crowdfunding project. GoDataDriven, who will soon move to the Wibautstraat in Amsterdam as well, didn't hesitate to secure its spot as one of the "crowdfounders" of the restaurant. </span>

After Baut and Baut Zuid, Restaurant C is the third operation of Michiel and Lucas van der Eerde. This time they decided to take the experience to a whole new level. Michiel, who is already well-known through his appearance on Dutch TV Show MasterChef, added sous-chef Arnout van der Kolk (Ciel Bleu **, Okura) to the kitchen squad.

"Over the past years the Wibautstraat has developed into one of the most dynamic and happening streets of Amsterdam. We are proud that Restaurant C has received support from neighbouring businesses like GoDataDriven to kickstart our restaurant", says Lucas van der Eerde, adding: "Data Science makes hungry, so we made sure to add a mouth-watering burger to our menu as well."

For GoDataDriven, one of the main reasons for the crowd funding is the support of other businesses in the Wibautstraat area and the development of the area. The Wibautstraat, also known as The Knowledge Mile, is one of the most vibrant streets in Amsterdam today, so like Restaurant C, GoDataDriven feels right at home.
