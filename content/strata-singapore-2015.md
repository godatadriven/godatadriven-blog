<span class="lead">Earlier this month Oâ€™Reilly and Cloudera organised the first Strata+Hadoop World conference in Asia. The conference was a resounding success, being sold out the first time it was organised. Of course GoDataDriven was present to get a taste of big data in the orient.</span>

On the program were many interesting talks, on topics ranging from developements in big data technology to privacy in big data. IThe talk of Singapore's foreign affairs minister Vivian Balakrishnan was particularly inspiring, showing what is possible using open data in Singapore.
On the technology side, it was great to see the improvements and additions currently being developed. We from GoDataDriven look forward to using this new technology in the future.

Although the majority of the attendees came from Asia, it was very good to see also Europeans in the crowd, showing that big data is a global endeavour.
