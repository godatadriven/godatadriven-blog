<span class="lead">Kendall's tau is a metric used to compare the order of two lists. It is only defined if both
lists contain exactly the same elements. When comparing only a part of two lists, for example the top-5 elements
generated by two recommenders, it cannot be used as these are unlikely to contain only common items. With a few
tricks one can however leverage the Kendall tau to compare such lists.</span>
