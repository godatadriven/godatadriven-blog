Last week, together with my colleagues TÃ¼nde and Kris, I had the honour to attend the [Cloudera Technical Summit](http://www.clouderatechsummit.com 'Cloudera Tech Summit') in Las Vegas. The Summit, held annually in Vegas, is accessible only to premier Cloudera partner and is the only event in the year where Cloudera partners get together with Clouderans and are treated as they were Clouderans (well,
except for the colour of the conference badge).

## Key take-aways from Cloudera Tech Summit 2015
For obvious reasons I cannot talk about the content of the sessions, but few things struck me:

#### Bigger is better
Europe is still trailing behind the US with regards to Hadoop adoption. Companies are still diffident and do not embrace Big Data so quickly. Clusters tend to be smaller (but, hey, everything in Europe is smaller when compared to the U.S., particularly in Vegas) and this limits the ability to just collect data and make it bloom;

#### Integration of Hadoop into production applications
Integration of Hadoop into production applications is happening, and it is happening a lot, mostly because of products born out of the Cloudera foundry (think of HBase, Flume, Sqoop), but not only (Solr and Kafka comes to mind);

#### Cloudera Search is hot
A proven technology such as Solr integrated in Cloudera gives engineers an edge when it comes to bringing search solutions into production;

#### Near real-time 
Even though I mostly work on the financial sector, I learned that we can actually never say Real Time when speaking about Big Data and in Finance: this is mostly due to latencies in all Big Data products and the general Finace product being order of magnitude different; the recently published article about [Cloudera and Santander](http://blog.cloudera.com/blog/2015/08/inside-santanders-near-real-time-data-ingest-architecture/ 'Inside Santander's near real-time data ingest architecture' ) corroborates this, as they always say Near Real Time;

#### Moving up
Cloudera gives a lot of thought to its product and the strategic roadmap, which is leading to adoptation of their products by more and more enterprise clients;

#### Scaling up
[Spark](http://spark.apache.org/ 'Spark) future is bright but [Impala](http://impala.io/ 'Impala') future (mostly thanks to projects such as [Ibis](http://www.ibis-project.org/ 'Ibis')) is just as bright if not brighter.

On top of that, the conference venue and all Clouderans were a blast: they not only are incredibly smart and talented, but also incredibly accessible and helpful. Hopefully until next year. In the mean time I am looking forward to the [Cloudera Sessions](http://go.cloudera.com/Sessions_2015_amsterdam_reg 'Cloudera sessions Amsterdam) that will take place in Amsterdam on October 15th. This will be the place to get up to speed with the latest developments and hook up with like-minded data scientists. Of course, GoDataDriven will be present there again as well.
