Located on the part of the Wibautstraat that is known as "The Knowledge Mile" GoDataDriven feels right at home.

Of course, the office was opened with a big celebration, including singers, dancers, fireworks, DJ, good food and lots of fun on our own indoor climbing wall. We are very proud that Mike Olson, co-founder of Cloudera, officially opened the office.
