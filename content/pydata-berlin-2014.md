GoDataDriven is sponsoring [Pydata Berlin](http://pydata.org/berlin2014/), that officially started
today. The conference schedule is full of amazing
[speakers](http://pydata.org/berlin2014/schedule/), but particularly dear to GoDataDriven are the
talk by [Vincent](http://pydata.org/berlin2014/abstracts/#269), a tutorial introducing pandas and
using ggplot with IPython, and by [Giovanni](http://pydata.org/berlin2014/abstracts/#246), who will
speak about how to build real time, data driven, web applications.

If you're in the venue, be sure to come and say hi (we'll buy you some great German beer). And if
you can't make it, we'll post the slides and the video of the talks to this blog once they become
available (but you'll lose the beer).
