<span class="lead">GoDataDriven congratulates Rogier van der Geer with his promotion at the University of Amsterdam. On September 1st, Rogier defended his thesis, titled "Searches for new physics through single top", and received the final verdict from his promotors and jury, rewarding him with a PhD in Physics.</span>

Rogier's research focuses on the analysis of data recorded by the Atlas experiment, the largest of the particle detectors of the Large Hadron Collider. 

## Large Hadron Collider (CERN) 

The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is a 27 km long circular particle accelerator buried 100 meters under the franco-swiss border near Geneva, Switzerland and smashes protons into each other at almost the speed of light.

Since the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012, the Standard Model of particle physics, which describes all elementary particles and their interactions, is complete. Nevertheless it still has some shortcomings: it fails to explain the existence of dark matter and the matter/antimatter asymmetry in the universe. Therefore there has to be more: "new physics" or physics beyond the Standard Model.

## Dark matter
In the roughly 1 billion collisions created by the LHC each second Rogier searched for the rare collisions in which a top quark is produced. The top quark is the heaviest elementary particle, with a mass more than 300 000 times larger than that of an electron.

Partly due to its very high mass, the interactions of the top quark are promising places to look for new physics. The processes in which a single top quark is produced (the top quark is usually produced in pairs) are especially interesting in this respect.

In these processes, Rogier searched for deviations from the Standard Model which could explain the existence of dark matter or the matter/antimatter asymmetry.

## Data Charmer

While finishing his research, Rogier joined GoDataDriven as Data Charmer. In this role, Rogier applies his academic background to business-issues of GoDataDriven's clients. Recent projects include the optimization of a popularity prediction model for mobile apps and a predictive supply chain management model for a large fresh food production company.

Rob Dielemans, Managing Director of GoDataDriven says; "The nature of our projects, requires our data scientists to make sense out of enormous amounts of data. A PhD contributes a lot to being successful as a data scientist. Besides intelligence, obtaining a Phd requires a lot of perseverance and hard work. Rogier has truly earned this title and we are convinced of the bright future that lies ahead of him."

With ROgier's promotion, GoDataDriven's world-class team of Data Scientists consists of no less than 5 PhD's.
