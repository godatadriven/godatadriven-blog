### Programme *Technology and Society: Burden or blessing?*

Markets are being disrupted by companies with new business models. Often, these new players are
technology-driven and extremely agile, which makes them highly responsive to changes in their
markets.

During the afternoon of September 16th, three speakers from different backgrounds and with diverse
experience, will share their opinion about the position of technology in our modern-day society and
talk about both opportunities and threats. At the end of the afternoon, you will understand more
about the impact of technology on society and why we should welcome or steer away from certain
developments. During the network drinks at the end of the programme, you will have plenty to discuss
this with the other participants!

The afternoon will be chaired by our host of the day Roderik van Grieken.
