The objective of the research is to create an overall view of Big Data adoption, plans and potential pitfalls. 

This survey is an initiative of trade show Big Data Expo and Big Data specialist GoDataDriven. 

## Big Data
Various studies point out that there is a direct cause between applying Big Data and substantial profit gains. There is no need to discuss the added value of Big Data and making smarter use of data in general. Of course, starting with the implementation of a Big Data straregy and building up expertise asks for an investment up front, but when implemented in the right way, the return on investment will be substantial. It is not the question if, but how, companies can make smarter use of their data. 

## Understanding the role of Big Data for businesses
Big Data Survey provides an insight in the
•	current role of Big Data in the board room
•	general opinion about consumer privacy
•	ethics of data collection
•	value of data as the currency of the future

We also take a look at the more practical side of Big Data: what is the general level of knowledge and what are the biggest challenges when becoming a data-driven enterprise? And finally, the research provides an insight in business processes and purposes of Big Data as well.
