This last November the 25th I had the pleasure to present at the 
Amsterdam Python UG at the [Byte] headquarters. Byte was so kind to not
only sponsor the location but also the food, so we had some typical 
Dutch meals such as *boerenkoolstamppot*, *zuurkoolstamppot* and 
*hutspot*.

There were 50 people at the event, but as it was fully booked more than 
100 people were in the waiting list. So I decided to make the slides 
available. There's a catch though! As you can see from the picture below
the talk was rather entertaining and the slides do not really convey 
that :)
