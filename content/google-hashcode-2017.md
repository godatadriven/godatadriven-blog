Excerpt: Fun algorithms/optimization competition where you can solve real Google problems

On February 23rd the annual Google Hash Code competition will take place, a unique event where smart industry professionals can team up to solve a real-life engineering problem from Google.

It's a fun algorithms/optimization competition. Our colleague Jelte Hoekstra competed last year: "Google Hashcode is a lot of fun, in 2016 I had a blast. Now that GoDataDriven has its own hangout, I figured this year we should make our office available as a hub."

## Google Hashcode
Think you could come up with a way to optimize Internet coverage for Project Loon balloons? Or how about routing Google Street View cars through Paris?

Step into the shoes of a Google engineer and tackle these types of challenges during Hash Code, a team-based programming competition for students and professionals (18+) across Europe, the Middle East and Africa organized by Google. You pick your team and programming language, we pick a real-life engineering problem to solve. Are you up for the challenge?

The competition is divided into two stages:

*an Online Qualification Round on 23rd February at 18:30 CET *

For this round, your team can participate from wherever youâ€™d like, including one of our Hash Code hubs. Hubs allow for teams in the same location (eg. city or university) to compete side-by-side in a more fun and exciting environment.

*a Final Round on 1st April *

Top scoring teams from the Online Qualification Round will be invited to Google Paris to compete in the Final Round of the competition.

## Program
The whole thing is just one night. Interested to participate? We have room for 5 - 10 teams. Make sure to sign up quickly and form a team in the process. GoDataDriven provides pizza's and drinks, Google wil send the goodies.
