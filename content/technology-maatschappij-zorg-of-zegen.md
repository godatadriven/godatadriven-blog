##Programme 'Technology and Society: Burden or blessing?' 

Markets are being disrupted by companies with transparent and new business models. Often, the new players are technology-driven and extremely agile, making them outstanding in responding to changes in the market.

During the afternoon of September 16th, three speakers from different backgrounds and experiences, will share their clear opinion about technology in modern-day society, both opportunities as well as threats.

### Uber
Uber delivers a better, safer and cheaper means of transportation per car and aims at making care-ownership in the city a thing of the past. Niek van Leeuwen will share his vision on the market developments for the near future. 

### Brenno de Winter
Next, Brenno de Winter will address companies and government on their digital missteps.

### TripAdvisor
Finally, Christine Petersen, former CMO of TripAdvisor, shares her experiences as a pioneer of online reviews en de influence on consumer'emancipation.

The afternoon will be chaired by host of the day Roderik van Grieken. At the end of the afternoon, you should have a better developed view of the impact of technology on society, and the question if we should welcome, or steer away it. During the network drinks at the end of the programme, there is enough room to discuss this with the other participants.

Registration is free of charge.
