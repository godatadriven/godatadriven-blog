During this session, Rik van Bruggen introduced the attendees to the fundamentals of graph databases. Also, he took some time to explore a interesting publicly available dataset, and import it into Neo4j and ask some interesting questions of the dataset.

Attendees were enthusiastic about the location and the presentations:

"I hadn't attended the Neo4j meetup for a while, but I noticed the product has matured a lot. It's always nice to meetup with the friendly Rik and Ron"

"Great content, awesome location."

The next Neo4j is scheduled for June 14: [Open Cypher - The graph query language](http://www.meetup.com/graphdb-netherlands/events/230867860/ "Graph Days Amsterdam").
