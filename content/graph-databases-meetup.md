During this session, Rik van Bruggen introduced the attendees to the fundamentals of graph databases. Also, he took some time to explore some interesting publicly available datasets, and import them into Neo4j and ask some interesting questions of the datasets. 

There was ample room to play around with various data sets including Dutch KvK data, NS GTFS datafeed, and Global Terrorism Database. 

Attendees were enthusiastic about the location and the presentations:

"I hadn't attended the neo4j meetup for a while, but I noticed the product has matured a lot. It's always nice to meetup with the friendly Rick and Ron"

"Great content, awesome location."

The next Neo4j is scheduled for May 8th: [GraphDays in Pakhuis de Zwijger on June 8](http://neo4j.com/graphdays/ "Graph Days Amsterdam").
